Recently, I retired two laptop hard drives, and while backing them up, I struck gold. Here’s a nugget I wrote as part of a scholarship application sometime during my freshman year of college. My best guess at the prompt I was responding to: “If you could speak to your high school self today, what advice would you share to help them succeed in college?”

*Be open minded. The unknown is always scary, but worrying will do you no good. Be friendly, smile, and new friends will not be hard to come by. Do everything you can to keep the fires of past friendships burning. Moving on to college is a big step, but it is only one chapter in an ever-changing work in progress. Be patient, but never routine. There is no such thing as a time limit when it comes to your dreams, goals, or aspirations. Move forward with your eyes fixed upon the sky. Make each step more sure than the last and you will never fall down. Rest easy now; good sleep is hard to come by.*

A little cheesy. A lot cliche. I still believe in most of it. That probably makes me naive. I think it’s okay to be naive about some things.

Cheers.
